In the present work, we describe a benchmark
of the particle-particle n-body algorithm,
using different many and multi-core scenarios,
with different techniques to take some advantage
in each case.

The previous work, showed a more programming vision
of the worst computational method of the \emph{n-body} problem,
considering only a high speed-up as a main issue,
without think in change the other important aspects
of this problem, like the integration method and
the initial population generation.

Most of the done work,
take only one or two computational approach,
considering CPU or GPU cores to perform the calculation,
but it is very important the fact that a good programming
in CPU can reach not the entire GPU speed-up, but a good
approximation, modifying the behind idea of the CPU implementation,
because in some implementation, the programmer forgot the strength
of a CPU-thread, which compared to a GPU-thread is more computationally strong.

Finally, is important to note that this three implementations
are basic ones, so, it is very possible to start a research to improve
the code, specially the CUDA implementation, because with some better
manipulation of the GPU memory, we could obtain more than the double
of the obtained speed-up.
